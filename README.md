# Operating System Projects

## Deadlock Detection:
**Description:** Create a program to simulate deadlock situations in an operating system. Implement deadlock detection techniques, such as circular wait or wait-for graph algorithms, and prevention strategies, such as the banker's algorithm, to avoid deadlocks.
**Objective:** Deepen understanding of deadlock concepts, including detection and prevention methods.

## Process Scheduling:
**Description:** Develop a program simulating three process scheduling algorithms: FCFS, RR, and SJF. Each algorithm serves processes differently based on arrival time and duration, analyzing system performance metrics such as waiting time and response time.
**Objective:** Understand various scheduling algorithms and their impact on operating system performance.

## Fork Summation:
**Description:** Implement a program using the fork() function to create and manage processes. Child processes will calculate portions of a summation of integers from a list, communicating results to the parent process. Proper termination of child processes is essential.
**Objective:** Gain practical experience in process creation and management.
